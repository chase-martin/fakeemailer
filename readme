Language/framework: For simplicity, this is a vanilla JS node app with no frameworks.
Libraries: The only modules required are sendgrid and html-to-text.
Tradeoffs: I did not have enough time to include mailgun or unit tests.
Time spent: This took almost the full 4 hours to code and push to github.
Other: 
 - Custom Errors allows for default error strings without hardcodeing accross the app.
 - The index.js files are meant to make importing (many) additional api routes and utils easier.

## To install:

`export SENDGRID_API_KEY='Sendgrid API Key'`
`export MAILGUN_API_KEY='Mailgun API Key'`
